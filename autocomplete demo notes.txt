steps to configure (windows)

IronPython2.7
NWSGI 2.1



step linux




1. pre-requisistes 
1.1 a working idol install on your network
1.2 content in the idol install 
1.3 ideally, use

[Server]
QuerySummaryAdvanced=true

the demo can be configured to work without this, but functionality will be reduced

2. prepare environment

2.1 install a webserver - I suggest httpd apache2 webserver which can be downloaded here:
http://apache.rediris.es//httpd/binaries/win32/httpd-2.2.22-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi

2.2. install python 2.6/2.7 - you can use www.python.org or activestate, I used this one:
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.amd64.msi

3. deploy demo
3.1 copy autocomplete_demo.zip to C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\cgi-bin
3.2 unzip, making sure the folder "autocomplete" is in the folder "cgi-bin" and not in a subfolder 

4. configure
4.1 Make sure Httpd/Apache knows where the python executable is - check the 1st line of  ...\cgi-bin\autocomplete\default.py points to your Python executable e.g.

#!/Python27/python.exe
points to 
C:\Python27\python.exe

and that python.exe exists in that directory-

If not, check step 2.2 &/or create this directory and copy your python.exe into the new directory, or, alternatively, amend all *.py files using an automated process.
 
4.2 Make sure the AJAX (jquery) javascript knows where the rest of the python codes is so it can use a shared config file - check this file

...\cgi-bin\autocomplete\ajax\autocomplete.py

sys.path.append("/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/cgi-bin/autocomplete")

points to the directory where the python code was deployed

4.3 Make sure the python code can find idol - edit 

...\cgi-bin\autocomplete\idol\config.py 

to point to your idol server


Notes: if you want to read the end of e.g. an httpd log file, use Notepadd++ or install the Windows 2003 Resource Kit tools: 

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17657

and then use tail.exe to look at the end of the file
